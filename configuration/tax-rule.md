# Tax Rule



> Tax rule means fixed, or variable amout/percentage to tax that applied for a product. (Please note that tax will be applied product level, not order level.)

## Before you set

Please note that if your country don't have variable taxes like inter-state tax, and the list price is tax included, you don't need to set tax rule.
