## Order State









## Order Status

There are three kind of status.



#### Overall Status

It is overall status of an order, and it is order level status.&#x20;

#### Order Status

Order status is very simulart to overall status. But it is item(line) level status. That means, the order status of each items within an order can be different.

(Let's say a customer ordered 3 items. In case the items are shipped individually, some items are shipped, but some items still in the warehouse. So the order status of each items can be assigned individually.)&#x20;

#### Dispute Status

Dispute status is status of the dispute from customer. Like order status, dispute status is item(line) level status. That means, customer can request partial refund, or partial reture.

There are three kind of dispute, 'Return', 'Replace', 'Refund'.
